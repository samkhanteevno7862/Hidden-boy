<p> Hello, Guyz This is #MEHWISH TeevNo your Host </p>
<p> In the previous chapter,</p>
  <p> you learned how to create a simple HTML page.</p>
    <p> Okay, it wasn't really up to much,</p>
      <p> but it was a real HTML page all the same.</p>

<p> As you know, a website consists of several pages.</p>
  <p> How do you go from one page to another? </p>
    <p> Using links of course! So how to create links</p>
      <p> between our pages is what we are going to learn to do this chapter.</p>
 <p>  I guess you all know what a link is: it's a text </p>
   <p> that you can click to go to another page.</p>
    <p>  You can make a link from a pagea.htmlto a page</p>
      <p> b.html, but you can also make a link </p>
     <p>    to another website (for example,</p>
       <p> http//www.facebook.com/mehwish.teevno.2 </p>
         <p> We'll see that both cases work in the same way.</p>
